&nbsp;Docker Linux Basic





&nbsp;1. Five DevOps Concepts



1\. Continuous Integration (CI) 

&nbsp;  Automating the building and testing of code every time a developer pushes changes.



2\. Continuous Deployment (CD) 

&nbsp;  Automatically deploying code to production after passing tests.



3\. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 

&nbsp;  Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code, e.g., Docker, Terraform.



4\. Version Control 

&nbsp;  Using Git to track changes in code and collaborate with others.



5\. Containerization  

&nbsp;  Packaging applications and their dependencies into containers to run consistently across environments.

3\. How does this help you learn DevOps, Linux, Git, and Docker?



DevOps:



Learned the concept of containerization and infrastructure as code (IaC).



Understood the workflow of building, running, and versioning applications in a reproducible environment.



Linux:



Practiced Linux commands inside a container without affecting the host OS.



Learned file management, navigation, and basic shell commands (ls, pwd, cat, etc.).



Git:



Learned version control: adding, committing, and pushing files to GitHub.



Understood remote repositories, branches, and syncing local changes with a cloud repository.



Docker:



Learned to write a Dockerfile, build Docker images, and run containers.



Practiced copying files into containers and managing images.



Learned to push images to Docker Hub for public sharing.
